			<h1>About XOXCO</h1>

			<p>XOXCO is a software product design and development studio. We create cutting-edge experiences through software. We believe technology should work for people. The company was founded in 2008 by Ben Brown and Katie Spence.</p>
			
			<p>Brown’s career in tech began in the '90s. He's had roles ranging from server administrator to CEO. He is an <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Brown_(blogger)" target="_blank">Internet publishing pioneer</a>, and has been the founder of several startups, most notably the tags-based dating site Consumating.com, which was  <a href="http://signalvnoise.com/archives2/consummating_consumatingcom.php" target="_blank">acquired by CNET Networks in 2005</a>. After a few years in Silicon Valley, Brown convinced Spence to leave her gig at a San Francisco design studio to start their own back home in Austin.</p>
			
			<p>In the last six years, we have worked with startups to define, develop and launch products. We have worked on R&D projects with Fortune 500 companies. 
			We have built a talented team of designers and developers who know how technology works, and who think creatively about software.</p>
			
			<blockquote>User experience. Product design. Software development. Prototypes, web sites, mobile apps, and APIs. It's all in our wheelhouse.</blockquote>
			
			<p>We’ve launched products. We’ve been through IPOs and acquisitions. We’ve helped dozens of organizations design, build and launch products - many of whom we work with still.</p>
			
			<p>We make things because it is fun and we want to know how things work. We'd like to make something for you. <a href="contact.html">Get in touch.</a></p>
